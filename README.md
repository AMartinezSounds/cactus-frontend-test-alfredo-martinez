# ![alt text](docs/logo.png "Title") Estudio Cactus Frontend Developer Test

This is the test for the candidates to our Front-end Developer job position at Estudio Cactus.

## Scenario

One of our best architect customer (Alessio Muganni) needs to build a landing page to show his professional profile to the world. On the first meeting with him he gave us some key aspects like:

- Modern look and feel.
- Smooth animtations and transitions.
- Most of his clients come from mobile.
- Clean design.
- Inspirantion websites: https://www.volvocars.com, https://drowart.com

After that, the team designed a low-fidelity prototype just to validate the structure with client, and this was approved. [Link here](docs/low-fidelity.pdf).
