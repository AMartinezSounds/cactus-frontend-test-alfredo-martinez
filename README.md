- Smooth animtations and transitions.
- Most of his clients come from mobile.

### Extra Client Request

The client has heard that Blogs are super important for SEO and websites, and now, he wants to create a create a blog section. He said that the design is up to us. So let's do something simple.

The only requirement should be that blog looks like:

1. Master section where the user could see all blog post (just post tile and thumbnail image)
2. Detail post section that displays the detail of post (post title, post body and image)



**API endpoints:**

[Posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
